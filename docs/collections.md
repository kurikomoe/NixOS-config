## nativeBuildInputs vs buildInputs

ref: https://discourse.nixos.org/t/use-buildinputs-or-nativebuildinputs-for-nix-shell/8464

nativeBuildInputs: 

Should be used for commands which need to run at build time (e.g. cmake) or shell hooks (e.g. autoPatchelfHook). These packages will be of the buildPlatforms architecture, and added to PATH.

buildInputs: 

Should be used for things that need to be linked against (e.g. openssl). These will be of the hostPlaformâ€™s architecture. With strictDeps = true; (or by extension cross-platform builds), these will not be added to PATH. However, linking related variables will capture these packages (e.g. NIX_LD_FLAGS, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH)
